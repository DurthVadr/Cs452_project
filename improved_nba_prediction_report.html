            <li>Historical NBA Elo ratings (nbaallelo.csv)</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h2>2. Data Exploration and Preparation</h2>
        
        <h3>2.1 Dataset Overview</h3>
        <p>The 2018-2019 NBA season consisted of 1,230 regular-season games. Our analysis revealed several key characteristics of the data:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Home teams won approximately <strong>57.3%</strong> of games</li>
            <li>The upset rate (favorites losing) was approximately <strong>34.1%</strong></li>
            <li>Back-to-back games accounted for approximately <strong>26.8%</strong> of all games</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h3>2.2 Feature Engineering</h3>
        <p>We created several features to improve prediction accuracy:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Team performance metrics (rolling win percentages over 5, 10, and 15 games)</li>
            <li>Back-to-back game indicators</li>
            <li>Team matchup history (head-to-head records)</li>
            <li>ELO rating differentials</li>
            <li>Four Factors differentials (eFG%, TOV%, ORB%, FTR)</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h2>3. ELO Rating System Analysis</h2>
        
        <h3>3.1 Original ELO System Performance</h3>
        <p>The original ELO rating system achieved an accuracy of <strong>63.0%</strong> on the test dataset. ELO ratings are a measure of team strength that update after each game based on the result and the pre-game rating difference.</p>
        
        <h3>3.2 Optimized ELO System</h3>
        <p>We optimized the ELO system by tuning two key parameters:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>K-factor: Controls how quickly ratings change (higher values mean faster changes)</li>
            <li>Home advantage: The rating bonus given to the home team</li>
        </ul>
        
        <p>After grid search optimization, the best parameters were:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>K-factor: <strong>30</strong></li>
            <li>Home advantage: <strong>50</strong></li>
        </ul>

            <div class="image-caption">Figure 1: ELO Parameter Search Results (Test Accuracy %)</div>
        </div>
        
        <p>The optimized ELO system achieved an accuracy of <strong>64.5%</strong>, an improvement of <strong>1.5%</strong> over the original system.</p>
        
        <h3>3.3 Final Team Ratings</h3>
        <p>The final ELO ratings after the 2018-2019 season show the relative strength of each team:</p>

        </div>
        
        <h3>4.2 Four Factors Analysis</h3>
        <p>The Four Factors of basketball success (developed by Dean Oliver) are:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Shooting (measured by effective field goal percentage, eFG%)</li>
            <li>Turnovers (measured by turnover rate, TOV%)</li>
            <li>Rebounding (measured by offensive rebound percentage, ORB%)</li>
            <li>Free throws (measured by free throw rate, FTR)</li>
        </ol>
        
        <p>Our analysis shows the win percentage when a team has an advantage in each factor:</p>
        
        <div class="image-container">
            <img src="images/four_factors_win_pct.png" alt="Four Factors Win Percentage">
            <div class="image-caption">Figure 4: Win Percentage When Team Has Advantage in Four Factors</div>
        </div>
        
        <p>Effective field goal percentage (eFG%) has the strongest correlation with winning, followed by turnover rate (TOV%).</p>
        
        <h3>4.3 Team Clustering</h3>
        <p>We clustered teams based on their playing style using various statistical metrics:</p>
        
        <div class="image-container">
            <img src="images/team_clusters.png" alt="Team Clustering">
            <div class="image-caption">Figure 5: Team Clustering Based on Playing Style</div>
        </div>
        
        <p>The four clusters represent different playing styles:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Cluster 1</strong>: High-tempo offensive teams with excellent shooting (e.g., Warriors, Rockets)</li>
            <li><strong>Cluster 2</strong>: Balanced teams with strong defense (e.g., Raptors, Bucks)</li>
            <li><strong>Cluster 3</strong>: Interior-focused teams with strong rebounding (e.g., 76ers, Nuggets)</li>
            <li><strong>Cluster 4</strong>: Defense-first teams with lower scoring (e.g., Jazz, Celtics)</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h3>4.4 Upset Analysis</h3>
        <p>Some teams were more prone to upsets (losing when favored) than others:</p>
        
        <div class="image-container">
            <img src="images/top_upset_teams.png" alt="Teams Most Likely to Be Upset">
            <div class="image-caption">Figure 6: Top 10 Teams Most Likely to Be Upset (When Favored)</div>
        </div>
        
        <p>Factors contributing to upsets include:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Back-to-back games (teams playing on consecutive days)</li>
            <li>Small ELO rating differences between teams</li>
            <li>Teams with inconsistent performance patterns</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h2>5. Prediction Model Development</h2>
        
        <h3>5.1 Model Selection</h3>
        <p>We evaluated several machine learning models for game prediction:</p>

            <div class="image-caption">Figure 7: Model Accuracy Comparison</div>
        </div>
        
        <p>The Gradient Boosting model performed best, achieving <strong>67.1%</strong> accuracy on the test dataset.</p>
        
        <h3>5.2 Feature Importance</h3>
        <p>The most important features for prediction were:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>ELO difference between teams</li>
            <li>Home team's effective field goal percentage (eFG%)</li>
            <li>Away team's effective field goal percentage (eFG%)</li>
            <li>Home team's recent win percentage</li>
            <li>Away team's turnover rate (TOV%)</li>
        </ol>
        
        <h3>5.3 Upset Prediction Model</h3>
        <p>We developed a specialized model for predicting upsets, which achieved <strong>50.0%</strong> accuracy on upset games, compared to <strong>40.0%</strong> for the ELO system.</p>
