# NBA Game Prediction: Executive Summary

## Project Overview

This project developed a machine learning system for predicting NBA game outcomes with a special focus on improving predictions of upsets (where underdogs win).

## Key Results

- **Best Model:** stacking_ensemble with 0.6911 accuracy
- **Models Evaluated:** 7
- **Average Ensemble Improvement:** 47.19% over base models

## Key Features

The most predictive features for NBA game outcomes include:

- Team ELO rating differences
- Recent team performance metrics
- Four Factors statistics (shooting efficiency, rebounding, etc.)
- Back-to-back game indicators

## Recommendations

1. Use the ensemble approach for the most accurate predictions
2. Pay special attention to fatigue factors (back-to-back games) for upset prediction
3. Continue collecting more detailed in-game statistics for future modeling

## Next Steps

1. Deploy model as a real-time prediction service
2. Develop player-level factors to account for injuries and lineup changes
3. Incorporate live betting odds for comparative analysis
