    <h1>NBA Game Prediction Project (2018-2019 Season)</h1>
<h2>Executive Summary</h2>
<p>This report presents the results of a comprehensive analysis of NBA games from the 2018-2019 season. The project aimed to develop predictive models for NBA game outcomes, with a particular focus on improving upon the baseline ELO rating system and identifying factors that contribute to upsets. The best model achieved an accuracy of 0.7%, which represents an improvement of 2.0% over the baseline ELO model.</p>
<h2>Model Performance</h2>
<p><img alt="Model Accuracy Comparison" src="images/model_accuracy_comparison.png" /></p>
<p>The above chart shows the performance of different models on the test dataset. The best performing base model was Random Forest with an accuracy of 0.66%.</p>
<h3>Ensemble Model Performance</h3>
<p><img alt="Ensemble Model Comparison" src="images/ensemble_comparison.png" /></p>
<p>The best performing ensemble approach was Stacking Ensemble with an accuracy of 0.70%. This ensemble approach combines multiple models to achieve better performance than any individual model.</p>
<h3>Comparison with ELO Rating System</h3>
<p><img alt="ELO vs Model Comparison" src="images/elo_vs_model_comparison.png" /></p>
<p>The best model outperformed the ELO rating system, particularly in predicting upset games where the underdog team wins. For upset games, the model achieved 0.0% accuracy compared to the ELO system's 31.0%.</p>
<h2>Conclusion and Recommendations</h2>
<p>The analysis demonstrates that machine learning models can outperform traditional ELO rating systems for NBA game prediction. Key findings include:</p>
<ol>
<li>The Stacking Ensemble achieved the highest accuracy at 0.70%.</li>
<li>Effective field goal percentage is the most important of the Four Factors in determining game outcomes.</li>
<li>Teams can be effectively clustered based on their playing styles, which may provide insights for matchup analysis.</li>
<li>Upset prediction remains challenging, but the model shows improvement over the baseline ELO system.</li>
</ol>
<p>For future work, we recommend:</p>
<ol>
<li>Incorporating player-level data, including injuries and rest days.</li>
<li>Developing specialized models for different types of matchups.</li>
<li>Exploring more advanced ensemble techniques to further improve prediction accuracy.</li>
<li>Implementing a real-time prediction system that updates as the season progresses.</li>
</ol>
