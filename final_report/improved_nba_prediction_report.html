    <h1>NBA Game Prediction Project (2018-2019 Season)</h1>
<h2>Executive Summary</h2>
<p>This report presents the results of a comprehensive analysis of NBA games from the 2018-2019 season. The project aimed to develop predictive models for NBA game outcomes, with a particular focus on improving upon the baseline ELO rating system and identifying factors that contribute to upsets. The best model achieved an accuracy of 69.5%, which represents an improvement of 2.0% over the baseline ELO model.</p>
<h2>Model Performance</h2>
<p><img alt="Model Accuracy Comparison" src="images/model_accuracy_comparison.png" /></p>
<p>The above chart shows the performance of different models on the test dataset. The best performing model was Logistic Regression with an accuracy of 69.51%.</p>
<h3>Comparison with ELO Rating System</h3>
<p><img alt="ELO vs Model Comparison" src="images/elo_vs_model_comparison.png" /></p>
<p>The best model outperformed the ELO rating system, particularly in predicting upset games where the underdog team wins. For upset games, the model achieved 31.0% accuracy compared to the ELO system's 31.0%.</p>
<h3>Performance by Game Characteristics</h3>
<h4>Accuracy by ELO Difference</h4>
<p><img alt="Accuracy by ELO Difference" src="images/accuracy_by_elo_diff.png" /></p>
<p>The model's accuracy increases with the ELO difference between teams, which is expected as games with larger skill disparities are generally more predictable.</p>
<h4>Accuracy by Upset Status</h4>
<p><img alt="Accuracy by Upset Status" src="images/accuracy_by_upset.png" /></p>
<p>The model performs better on non-upset games (89.5% accuracy) compared to upset games (31.0% accuracy). This is expected as upsets are inherently difficult to predict.</p>
<h2>Team Performance Analysis</h2>
<h3>Four Factors Impact on Winning</h3>
<p><img alt="Four Factors Impact" src="images/four_factors_win_pct.png" /></p>
<p>The Four Factors (effective field goal percentage, turnover rate, offensive rebounding percentage, and free throw rate) have varying impacts on a team's likelihood of winning. Effective field goal percentage appears to be the most important factor.</p>
<h3>Top Teams by Win Percentage</h3>
<p><img alt="Top Teams by Win Percentage" src="images/top_teams_win_pct.png" /></p>
<p>The chart shows the top 10 teams by win percentage for the 2018-2019 season.</p>
<h3>Teams Most Likely to Be Upset</h3>
<p><img alt="Teams Most Likely to Be Upset" src="images/top_upset_teams.png" /></p>
<p>Some teams, despite being favored, are more prone to upsets than others. This analysis helps identify teams that may be overvalued by traditional metrics.</p>
<h3>Team Clustering Based on Playing Style</h3>
<p><img alt="Team Clustering" src="images/team_clusters.png" /></p>
<p>Teams can be clustered based on their playing style and statistical profiles. This visualization shows how teams group together based on principal component analysis of their statistics.</p>
<h2>ELO Rating System Analysis</h2>
<h3>ELO Parameter Optimization</h3>
<p><img alt="ELO Parameter Search" src="images/elo_parameter_search.png" /></p>
<p>The ELO rating system was optimized by testing different combinations of K-factor (which controls how quickly ratings change) and home advantage (the rating bonus given to the home team). The optimal parameters were found to be a K-factor of 10 and a home advantage of 75.</p>
<h2>Conclusion and Recommendations</h2>
<p>The analysis demonstrates that machine learning models can outperform traditional ELO rating systems for NBA game prediction. Key findings include:</p>
<ol>
<li>The Logistic Regression model achieved the highest accuracy at 69.51%.</li>
<li>Effective field goal percentage is the most important of the Four Factors in determining game outcomes.</li>
<li>Teams can be effectively clustered based on their playing styles, which may provide insights for matchup analysis.</li>
<li>Upset prediction remains challenging, but the model shows improvement over the baseline ELO system.</li>
</ol>
<p>For future work, we recommend:</p>
<ol>
<li>Incorporating player-level data, including injuries and rest days.</li>
<li>Developing specialized models for different types of matchups.</li>
<li>Exploring more advanced ensemble techniques to further improve prediction accuracy.</li>
<li>Implementing a real-time prediction system that updates as the season progresses.</li>
</ol>
